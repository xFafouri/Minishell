Implement the following built-ins:
— echo (option -n only)
— exit
— env (with no options or arguments)
— export (with no options)
— unset (with no options)
- cd 
pwd


----
To implement cd, you basically need to

Use chdir() to change the current directory
Update some environment variables (like Klas Lindback said: OLDPWD and PWD)

-----------------------------


echo	echo the STRING(s) to standart output. -n flag: do not output the trailing newline
cd	    change the shell working directory (with a relative or absolute path)
pwd	   print name of current/working directory
export	set export attribute for shell variables
unset	unset values of shell variables
env	print the environment
exit	cause the shell to exit with the exit status specified
